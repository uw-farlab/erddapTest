      <title>Winter Bottom Trawl Survey</title>
      <abstract>The standardized NEFSC Winter Bottom Trawl Survey was initiated in 1992 and covered offshore areas from the Mid-Atlantic to Georges Bank.  Inshore strata were covered from 1992-2007 but were later dropped, as few flatfish of interest were captured.  Deep strata (183-366 m) were not covered consistently until 1998.</abstract>
      <purpose>The winter survey mission was to address the perceived low catchability of flatfish in the spring and autumn surveys.  In 2007, the survey ended when it became clear that the new vessel and gear would capture flatfish adequately.</purpose>

         <description>The 1999 Winter Resource Survey Report consists of field notes, station and catch summaries, and a series of geographical plots of commercial and recreationally important species caught during the Ecosystem Surveys Branch's winter bottom trawl resource cruise. Specific details about the nets, doors, liners, and dredges used during these trips can be found within each report. Tow duration and areas of operation will also vary depending on the type of survey. All stations are randomly selected and catches can be light compared with commercial tows. Also, vessel operations are on a 24-hour basis and catches have not been adjusted for day/night differences. Nevertheless, this data can provide fishermen with useful information about the distribution and relative abundance of species inhabiting the survey area (Cape Hatteras to Georges Bank).</description>

               <description>Code uniquely identifying a cruise or cruise component.  CRUISE_OLD is used to idently the three-digit cruise code used before 1981, and match it to the newly assigned code found in the field CRUISE6.  Prior to 1981, cruises were made up of four or more separate components based on geographic location of collected data.  These components were assigned separate cruise codes, but were actually part of an entire bottom trawl survey.  Therefore, there may be four or more separate cruise codes that make up one bottom trawl survey.</description>

               <description>A predefined area where a net dredge, or other piece of gear was deployed.  Code consists of 2 parts:  Stratum group code number (2 bytes) and stratum number (3 bytes).  Stratum group refers to if area fished is inshore or offshore North or South of Cape Hatteras or the type of cruise (shellfish, State of MA, offshore deepwater).  The stratum number (third and fourth digits of code) refers to area defined by depth zone.  See SVDBS.SVMSTRATA.  The fifth digit of the code increases the length of the stratum number for revised strata after the Hague Line was established.  Stratum group code: 01 = Trawl, offshore north of Hatteras; 02 = BIOM; 03 = Trawl, inshore north of Hatteras; 04 = Shrimp; 05 = Scotian shelf; 06 = Shellfish; 07 = Trawl, inshore south of Hatteras; 08 = Trawl, Offshore south of Hatteras; 09 = MA DMF; 99 = Offshore deepwater (outside the stratified area). A change in Bottom Trawl Stratum for the Gulf of Maine-Bay of Fundy has been in effect since Spring 1987, and may be summarized as follows:  Previous strata:  01350; Present strata:  01351, 01352.</description>

               <description>A predefined area where a net dredge, or other piece of gear was deployed.  Code consists of 2 parts:  Stratum group code number (2 bytes) and stratum number (3 bytes).  Stratum group refers to if area fished is inshore or offshore North or South of Cape Hatteras or the type of cruise (shellfish, State of MA, offshore deepwater).  The stratum number (third and fourth digits of code) refers to area defined by depth zone.  See SVDBS.SVMSTRATA.  The fifth digit of the code increases the length of the stratum number for revised strata after the Hague Line was established.  Stratum group code: 01 = Trawl, offshore north of Hatteras; 02 = BIOM; 03 = Trawl, inshore north of Hatteras; 04 = Shrimp; 05 = Scotian shelf; 06 = Shellfish; 07 = Trawl, inshore south of Hatteras; 08 = Trawl, Offshore south of Hatteras; 09 = MA DMF; 99 = Offshore deepwater (outside the stratified area). A change in Bottom Trawl Stratum for the Gulf of Maine-Bay of Fundy has been in effect since Spring 1987, and may be summarized as follows:  Previous strata:  01350; Present strata:  01351, 01352.</description>

               <description>A predefined area where a net dredge, or other piece of gear was deployed.  Code consists of 2 parts:  Stratum group code number (2 bytes) and stratum number (3 bytes).  Stratum group refers to if area fished is inshore or offshore North or South of Cape Hatteras or the type of cruise (shellfish, State of MA, offshore deepwater).  The stratum number (third and fourth digits of code) refers to area defined by depth zone.  See SVDBS.SVMSTRATA.  The fifth digit of the code increases the length of the stratum number for revised strata after the Hague Line was established.  Stratum group code: 01 = Trawl, offshore north of Hatteras; 02 = BIOM; 03 = Trawl, inshore north of Hatteras; 04 = Shrimp; 05 = Scotian shelf; 06 = Shellfish; 07 = Trawl, inshore south of Hatteras; 08 = Trawl, Offshore south of Hatteras; 09 = MA DMF; 99 = Offshore deepwater (outside the stratified area). A change in Bottom Trawl Stratum for the Gulf of Maine-Bay of Fundy has been in effect since Spring 1987, and may be summarized as follows:  Previous strata:  01350; Present strata:  01351, 01352.</description>

               <description>A predefined area where a net dredge, or other piece of gear was deployed.  Code consists of 2 parts:  Stratum group code number (2 bytes) and stratum number (3 bytes).  Stratum group refers to if area fished is inshore or offshore North or South of Cape Hatteras or the type of cruise (shellfish, State of MA, offshore deepwater).  The stratum number (third and fourth digits of code) refers to area defined by depth zone.  See SVDBS.SVMSTRATA.  The fifth digit of the code increases the length of the stratum number for revised strata after the Hague Line was established.  Stratum group code: 01 = Trawl, offshore north of Hatteras; 02 = BIOM; 03 = Trawl, inshore north of Hatteras; 04 = Shrimp; 05 = Scotian shelf; 06 = Shellfish; 07 = Trawl, inshore south of Hatteras; 08 = Trawl, Offshore south of Hatteras; 09 = MA DMF; 99 = Offshore deepwater (outside the stratified area). A change in Bottom Trawl Stratum for the Gulf of Maine-Bay of Fundy has been in effect since Spring 1987, and may be summarized as follows:  Previous strata:  01350; Present strata:  01351, 01352.</description>

               <description>A predefined area where a net dredge, or other piece of gear was deployed.  Code consists of 2 parts:  Stratum group code number (2 bytes) and stratum number (3 bytes).  Stratum group refers to if area fished is inshore or offshore North or South of Cape Hatteras or the type of cruise (shellfish, State of MA, offshore deepwater).  The stratum number (third and fourth digits of code) refers to area defined by depth zone.  See SVDBS.SVMSTRATA.  The fifth digit of the code increases the length of the stratum number for revised strata after the Hague Line was established.  Stratum group code: 01 = Trawl, offshore north of Hatteras; 02 = BIOM; 03 = Trawl, inshore north of Hatteras; 04 = Shrimp; 05 = Scotian shelf; 06 = Shellfish; 07 = Trawl, inshore south of Hatteras; 08 = Trawl, Offshore south of Hatteras; 09 = MA DMF; 99 = Offshore deepwater (outside the stratified area). A change in Bottom Trawl Stratum for the Gulf of Maine-Bay of Fundy has been in effect since Spring 1987, and may be summarized as follows:  Previous strata:  01350; Present strata:  01351, 01352.</description>

               <description>Code concerning station details. This defines the type of sampling conducted at each station. Standard NEFSC BTS tows are coded with a T value = 1. The T value=1 is subdivided into 6 components: 1- Random Tow, within 1nm Radius; 1- Random Tow, outside 1nm, within 3nm Radius; 1- Repeat Tow; 1- Random Altername; 1- Random Offshore Continental Shelf; 1- Altername Offshore Protocol.  Tow types other than NEFSC BTS standard random tows are defined by the following code values: 2- Non-Random Tow - Tow is not conducted according a random and stratified statistical design. Tow must follow NEFSC BTS protocols.; 3- Survey Standardization - Tow conducted to evaluate NEFSC BTS standardization (i.e. gear testing); 4- Comparison Tow - Tow conducted in comparison of other gears, surveys, vessels or operating procedures ; 5- Aborted Tow - Gear set but timed tow duration never started (aborted tow); 6- Site Specific - Non-random tow conducted in a specific, targeted region; 7- Experimental Survey Design - Survey design type other than random and stratified (i.e. transect, depletion study, grid, fixed etc.); 8 Other - Tows that do not fall into the previous categories. Detailed description of the tow type shall be recorded.</description>

               <description>A concatentation of the T, O, G and A codes assigned to an operation.  Each standard survey tow is evaluated based on four categories, Type, Operational, Gear and Acquisition (T.O.G.A.). Type (T), Operational (O) and Gear (G) categories are used to validate each tow; the Acquisition (A) category is additional information not used for validation. T.O.G.A. is a detailed analysis of survey trawl and vessel performance during each tow, utilizing available data from trawl mensuration systems and vessel sensors not previously analyzed by the historical Station, Haul, and Gear (S.H.G.) coding system.</description>
